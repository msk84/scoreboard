## Idea
Idea is to have a simple webapplication for displaying results of dartsgames on match days or during tournaments on a screen. The results can be added / updates by different kinds of devices (e.g. mobile phones, notebooks, ...). The application is running on a local device (e.g. notebook, raspberry pi, ...) in a location without internet connection but with a WI-FI. Data is persisted in a local database.
In a later step there might be a possibility to sync data asynchronously to a place on the internet with a temporaty network connection (e.g. provided by a mobile device).
